- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-01-14 Fri 18:21]
- [X] Create =/fs/cbsuclarkfs1/storage/ivc2/turkana=.
- [X] Make the local folder a git and github repo.
- [X] Clone repo to =~/turkana= in the cluster.
- [X] Set up an archival document locally for Turkana todos.

- [X] Prepare snakefile for preparing the raw data.
- [X] Rule: concatenate SFS raw data files and convert into proper SFS.
- [X] Prepare snakefile for plotting in R.
  - [X] Look up access to snakemake variables in an R notebook
  - [X] Create conda environment for R notebooks
- [X] Rule: plot proper SFS together with a 1/n SFS to see if it fits neutrality.
  - [X] Look up the 1/n plotting in Ronen et al., 2013
  - [X] Normalize raw SFS
  - [X] Add reference for 1/x SFS
  - [X] Color, labels, prettify, etc.

- [X] Set up simulations locally
  - [X] Same set of scripts, etc. as the Drosophila project.
  - [X] Set up easy to use neutral parameters
  - [X] Run locally to test the configs
- [X] Simulation parameters
  - [X] Constant Ne of 10,000.
  - [X] Look up size of locus in my notes and in the raw empirical data
  - [X] Look up human mutation and recombination rate in SLiM manual.
  - [X] Change =project_parameters=: size of locus, smallest window size.
  - [X] Pi normalization
    - [X] Data preparation rule with =vcftools= windowed pi of empirical data.
    - [X] What's the highest value? Use that as normalization.
  - [X] Number of SNPs normalization: use total number in empirical VCF
  - [X] Test local simulations with these parameters. Note run time, window sizes.
- [X] Make a simple hard sweep config, with s between 0.1% and 100%. That's 3 orders of magnitude
- [X] Use recapitation instead of a coalescent burn-in.
  - [X] Git update everything, so all files are backed up nicely.
  - [X] No rule for burn-in, burn-in not required.
  - [X] Slim templates don't read burn-ins anymore.
  - [X] Slim templates get a population size parameter and initialize their subpops.
  - [X] Test run it now.
  - [X] Look up recapitation recipe.
  - [X] Add recapitation to mutation dropping script.
  - [X] Test run it again.
  - [X] Change name of mutation dropping everywhere to recapitation and mutation dropping
  - [X] Update git with a new branch
  - [X] Try updating SLiM to 3.7, see if that removes the warning we're getting
- [X] Set up cluster simulations
  - [X] Update slim on cluster to 3.7, add it to =~/bin/slim3.7=
  - [X] Fetch and merge repo on cluster
  - [X] Same set of scripts, etc. as the Drosophila project
  - [X] Edit slurm script
  - [X] Edit slurm submission script: can do more simulations per job, now
  - [X] Create conda repo on cluster using snakemake
  - [X] Debug cluster simulations
  - [X] Clean cluster =raw-simulations= folder
  - [X] Run neutral and 80% (ongoing) (hard) sweep simulations to start as a test, with 5000 simulations
  - [X] Update git from cluster
  - [X] Update local repo
